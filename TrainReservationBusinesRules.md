# Business Rules & Policies

## Train Reservation Service

There are various business rules and policies around which seats may be reserved.

For a train overall, **no more than 70% of seats may be reserved** in advance, and ideally **no individual coach should have no more than 70% reserved** seats either.

However, there is another business rule that says you must put **all the seats** for one reservation **in the same coach**.

This could make you and go over 70% for some coaches, **just make sure to keep to 70% for the whole train**.
